# CCS PLAYGROUND 🦜
So what is CCS Playground ??? It's my collection of CCS snippets, animations, buttons, sliders etc. I'll keep them in this repository - organized ! Most of them are pure CSS/SASS. In some cases I was using external libraries, which will be provided in JS folder.

## Installation 🙅‍♂️
no installation is required 

## Usage 🥢
Most of the examples can be runned without live server plugin, if it didn't run, try live server VS code plugin or etc
